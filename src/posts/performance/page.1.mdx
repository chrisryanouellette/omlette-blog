# Introduction

Oh boy, this is going to be a fun one! Full disclaimer, this article may not be a preferred or even recommended way to learn about front end performance but, instead it is the path I took. The goal is to gain a deeper understanding on how to measure performance and fix common issues that a corporation may face if they have a larger code base.

The article is a work in progress and more pages will be published as the journey unfolds.

Let's dive in and see where we end up popping up!
